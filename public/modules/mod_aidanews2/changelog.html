<b>Version 2.1.0 - J!2.5</b><br/>
<br/>
[+] New Image Library! (https://github.com/masterexploder/PHPThumb);<br/>
[+] New Joomla! 2.5 article image fields are supported;<br/>
[+] Sticky (Important) Articles Option: insert some article ids, and those articles will be displayed on top in the order you wrote them. If there's room for other articles, they will be selected as usual;<br/>
[+] Javascript Pagination, at last! Select how many articles to display per page, where to show the navigation buttons and more. Please remember it's non AJAX, so all articles get loaded with the page;<br/>
[+] CSS Field has been replaced with CSS FieldS: their behaviour is the same as the old AiDaNews"1" fields;<br/>
[+] AiDaQuick: use more lighter queries. Designed for sites with a lot of articles, tell me if it makes your site faster!<br/>

[>] JComments and Udja Comments are now supported!<br/>
[>] Some new CSS classes: today shows up only if the article's date is today's date;<br/>
[>] The catid css class lets you style each article differently depending on the category it's in;<br/>
[>] If you use a gallery plugin with non-default base gallery settings, now there's a field that allows you to make everything work without hacking the module;<br/>
[>] Current Category Only now works properly both in category and article views. You can also select what to show in the other views;<br/>
[>] A new field lets you input a custom grid column width if you don't like the automatically calculated one;<br/>
[>] You can now use Language Files for some text - text in positions still can't be translated automatically though;<br/>
[>] The module now checks if the Thumbnails class has already been loaded by some other extension before loading it (will be useful soon... :D);<br/>
[*] Corrected problem with double quotes in text;<br/>
[*] Kunena Avatars are now displayed correctly;<br/>
[*] If the module cannot reach the Server to check for updates, a notice will appear in the module's backend;<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

[+] Each article now gets a CSS class with the catid of the category it's in;<br/>
[+] Using the '[st]' tag in the date output field will make the module automagically show 'st', 'nd', 'rd' or 'th' depending on the number of the day (%d[st] gets changed to 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th...);<br/>
[+] New options for ratings: round and stars.<br/>
[+] You can now choose wheter to display Trashed articles or not (just like frontpage articles);<br/>
